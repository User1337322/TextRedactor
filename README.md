## About Compose
Compose is a text editor written in Java, specifically [JavaFX][JavaFX-Link]. It serves as a text editor to help you keep your note-taking in check.

## Highlights

### Pleasant Theming
With color appeal on the rise, Compose came prepared with themes -- more are on the way!

#### Darc Theme
Dark theme enthusiasts, rejoice!

#### Light Theme
Light theme users, rejoice!

#### Fresh Theme
Want something fresh and out there? You can rejoice too!

### Configurable Settings
Easily change the text wrap, font, font size, and theme -- Compose auto-magically saves your settings for you to come back later.

## Building the Source Code
1. If you don't already have it, download [Git][Git-Link]. It's a powerful source control tool, and is the same source control that Compose uses.
    
- You don't need to have Gradle installed to build Compose -- Gradle projects come with the build tool specialized for the project already.
    
2. Using Git, clone the Compose repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lucasstarsz/Compose.git
    ```

3. Once you've entered the top directory of the project (`cd Compose`), build the project using the `gradlew` file.
    - On Windows, you'll want to use the `gradlew.bat` file.
    - On Unix-based systems (macOS, Linux), you'll need to use the `gradlew.sh` file (after giving it proper execution permissions).
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```
